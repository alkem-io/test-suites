## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

","## Who is involved with Alkemio?

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

For additional details on project partners and supporters please look at our [website](https://alkem.io/).
","## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

Meanwhile, the share of sector-allocable aid to agriculture from all donors fell from nearly 25 per cent in the mid-1980s to only 5 per cent in 2018, representing $12.8 billion. The fall in agricultural aid is due to a shift in donors’ focus to social-sector issues, such as improving governance, building social capital and helping fragile states.","Global community",c1ebf680-d051-46bf-8342-49f2dde362c4,26ac70c9-2cc8-4fcd-aafb-32b76cef79a2

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",5f949f32-1b8c-4d43-82a8-b6a71bbadee0,d896d2fc-9f2e-4b98-9db3-21c9ecfb4669

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## [Why Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#why-alkemio)

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

## [How do I get started?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#how-do-i-get-started)

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## [Why Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#why-alkemio)

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

> "Music has the ability to bypass the logical part of our brain and speak directly to our emotions. A single song can transport us back to a specific memory, make us laugh, cry, or erupt in joy. It's a powerful tool that can connect us to ourselves and others on a profound level."

<strong>2. Music as a Unifying Force:</strong>

> "Music transcends language and cultural barriers. Regardless of where you come from or what language you speak, music has the power to bring people together. A shared love of a particular genre or artist can spark friendships and create a sense of community."

<strong>3. The Impact of Music on Social Change:</strong>

> "Music has a long history of being a catalyst for social change. From protest songs that raise awareness of injustice to anthems that inspire hope and unity, music can be a powerful tool for activism. It can give voice to the voiceless and inspire action."

<strong>4. The Importance of Music Education:</strong>

> "Learning music is not just about becoming a virtuoso performer. It teaches discipline, creativity, and collaboration skills. It also enhances cognitive development and improves memory. Music education is a valuable asset that should be accessible to everyone."

<strong>5. A Personal Reflection on the Role of Music in Your Life:</strong>

> "Music has always been a constant companion in my life. It's there to celebrate the good times, uplift me during the bad, and provide solace when I need it most. Whether it's a song that reminds me of a loved one or a piece that inspires me, music has a profound impact on who I am."

These are just a few examples, and the possibilities for meaningful text on the topic of music are endless. You can explore the history of music, discuss the technical aspects of music theory, or delve into the cultural significance of different musical genres.
","### <strong>1914 translation by H. Rackham</strong>

"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
","### <strong>Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC</strong>

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.

This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",3d701415-5c4d-458c-8596-14dbc0a2924d,f4a47586-49e5-45a4-97dd-d09258771dfd

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).
","## Connecting + Getting Help

The best place to start is on our [**github discussions**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions). There you can raise ideas, ask for help, connect with others etc.

If at any point you would like more information, or connect more directly to the team behind the platform, then please feel to reach out via <community@alkem.io>!
","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",8bb44f37-c824-4dbe-95ab-4ccfb6bfdee7,2a45a8f3-41bc-4b88-8e87-21800f72147b

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

Links
-----

- You can insert links in text like [this](/tutorial.md)

- You may add a [title](https://agea.github.io/tutorial.md "Markdown Tutorial") to your link (can you see the tooltip?)

- If your link contains spaces you have to write the [link](<http://example.com/a space>) between `<>`

- You can use spaces and markup inside the [link **text**](https://agea.github.io/tutorial.md)

- Long links may decrease source readability, so it's posible to define all links somewhere in the document (the end is a good place) and just reference the [link][tutorial.md], you may also collapse the reference if it matches the link text (example:  [tutorial.md][])

- You may also write directly the link: <https://agea.github.io/tutorial.md>

- It will work also for email addresses: <email@example.com> (you may write vaild email links also using [mailto](mailto:email@example.com) as protocol)

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

<strong>A Summary of the Short Story</strong><span> </span>[<strong>"Miss Brill"</strong>](https://www.thoughtco.com/miss-brills-fragile-fantasy-1690510)<span> </span><strong>by Katherine Mansfield</strong>\
"'Miss Brill' is the story of an old woman told brilliantly and realistically, balancing thoughts and emotions that sustain her late solitary life amidst all the bustle of modern life. Miss Brill is a regular visitor on Sundays to the Jardins Publiques (the Public Gardens) of a small French suburb where she sits and watches all sorts of people come and go. She listens to the band playing, loves to watch people and guess what keeps them going, and enjoys contemplating the world as a great stage upon which actors perform. She finds herself to be another actor among the so many she sees, or at least herself as 'part of the performance after all.' One Sunday Miss Brill puts on her fur and goes to the Public Gardens as usual. The evening ends with her sudden realization that she is old and lonely, a realization brought to her by a conversation she overhears between a boy and a girl, presumably lovers, who comment on her unwelcome presence in their vicinity. Miss Brill is sad and depressed as she returns home, not stopping by as usual to buy her Sunday delicacy, a slice of honey-cake. She retires to her dark room, puts the fur back into the box and imagines that she has heard something cry." -K. Narayana Chandran.
","## <strong>Steps in Composing a Summary</strong>

The primary purpose of a summary is to "give an accurate, objective representation of what the work says." As a general rule, "you should not include your own ideas or interpretations." -Paul Clee and Violeta Clee

"Summarizing condenses in your own words the main points in a passage:

1.  Reread the passage, jotting down a few keywords.
2.  State the main point in your own words and be objective. Don't mix your reactions with the summary.
3.  Check your summary against the original, making sure that you use [quotation marks](https://www.thoughtco.com/guidelines-for-using-quotation-marks-correctly-1691757) around any exact phrases that you borrow." -Randall VanderMey, et al.
","## <strong>Characteristics of a Summary</strong>

"The purpose of a summary is to give a reader a condensed and objective account of the main ideas and features of a text. Usually, a summary has between one and three paragraphs or 100 to 300 words, depending on the length and complexity of the original essay and the intended [audience](https://www.thoughtco.com/audience-rhetoric-and-composition-1689147) and purpose. Typically, a summary will do the following:

*   <strong>Cite the author and title of the text.</strong> In some cases, the place of publication or the context for the essay may also be included.
*   <strong>Indicate the main ideas of the text.</strong> Accurately representing the main ideas (while omitting the less important details) is the major goal of the summary.
*   <strong>Use</strong><span> </span>[<strong>direct quotations</strong>](https://www.thoughtco.com/direct-quotation-composition-1690461)<span> </span><strong>of keywords, phrases, or sentences.</strong> <em>Quote</em> the text directly for a few key ideas; [<em>paraphrase</em>](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-paraphrase-1691573) the other important ideas (that is, express the ideas in your own words).
*   <strong>Include author tags.</strong> ("According to Ehrenreich" or "as Ehrenreich explains") to remind the reader that you are summarizing the author and the text, not giving your own ideas.
*   <strong>Avoid summarizing specific examples or data</strong> unless they help illustrate the [thesis](https://www.thoughtco.com/thesis-composition-1692546) or main idea of the text.
*   <strong>Report the main ideas as objectively as possible.</strong> Do not include your reactions; save them for your response. -(Stephen Reid, <em>The Prentice Hall Guide for Writers</em>, 2003)

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).
","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.
","## Who is involved with Alkemio?

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

The best place to start is on our [**github discussions**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions). There you can raise ideas, ask for help, connect with others etc.

If at any point you would like more information, or connect more directly to the team behind the platform, then please feel to reach out via <community@alkem.io>!
","## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).
","## Who is involved with Alkemio?

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

In het programma Totaal Driedimensionaal (T3D) werken de VNG en de gemeenten Amsterdam, Rotterdam en Den Haag samen aan praktische oplossingen voor het in 3D inwinnen, registreren en gebruiken van basisgegevens over de fysieke leefomgeving.



Het programma T3D beproeft en realiseert innovatieve, schaalbare en efficiënte oplossingen en standaarden voor het volledig 3D inwinnen, registreren en gebruiken van objectinformatie. Op basis daarvan draagt T3D bij aan de nadere uitwerking van het gemeentelijke perspectief op de doorontwikkeling van de huidige geo-basisregistraties en de realisatie van de Samenhangende objectenregistratie (SOR).



In de huidige praktijk worden 3D modellen door de o","

Voor inwoners en ondernemers gaat dit leiden tot innovaties in de dienstverlening en een betere basisinformatievoorziening voor de aanpak van tal van maatschappelijke vraagstukken.



Ook andere overheden zullen hiervan de vruchten plukken. Denk bij concrete resultaten bijvoorbeeld aan een efficiënter vergunningproces, lagere onderzoekskosten voor nieuwe ontwikkelingen, lagere faalkosten bij projecten in de openbare ruimte en beter beheer van (gemeentelijk) vastgoed.



Daarnaast leidt het tot efficiëntere en kwalitatief hoogwaardige bijhoudingsprocessen van 3D objectinformatie.","-

To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",8dd0b626-e475-4790-8431-8ff3e32fcfa4,b3c58ba0-941d-40c2-97e2-28013229bdd6

","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.
","## Connecting + Getting Help

The best place to start is on our [**github discussions**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions). There you can raise ideas, ask for help, connect with others etc.

If at any point you would like more information, or connect more directly to the team behind the platform, then please feel to reach out via <community@alkem.io>!

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).
","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)
","## Who is involved with Alkemio?

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",ab6f42cc-c9f6-4e8d-bb7d-70c25ab086de,30875d45-7d15-4710-a330-adcbf182fbd2

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",b30c6e32-06b1-47e6-8ad7-2ddcf1aefa3e,e1dff9a8-c61c-40d5-bbe9-b7e52d5f49be

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## [Why Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#why-alkemio)

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

## [Who is involved with Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#who-is-involved-with-alkemio)

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

For additional details on project partners and supporters please look at our [website](https://alkem.io/).

## [Connecting + Getting Help](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#connecting--getting-help)

The best place to start is on our [**github discussions**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions). There you can raise ideas, ask for help, connect with others etc.

If at any point you would like more information, or connect more directly to the team behind the platform, then please feel to reach out via <community@alkem.io>!

## [How do I get started?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#how-do-i-get-started)

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## [Why Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#why-alkemio)

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do [**check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/blob/develop/docs/why-alkemio.md).

## [Who is involved with Alkemio?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#who-is-involved-with-alkemio)

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

For additional details on project partners and supporters please look at our [website](https://alkem.io/).

## [Connecting + Getting Help](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#connecting--getting-help)

The best place to start is on our [**github discussions**](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions). There you can raise ideas, ask for help, connect with others etc.

If at any point you would like more information, or connect more directly to the team behind the platform, then please feel to reach out via <community@alkem.io>!

## [How do I get started?](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio#how-do-i-get-started)

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

However, millions of people throughout the world still lack such access, and progress on facilitating access to clean cooking fuels and technologies is too slow. The pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and affordable electricity in health centres. In addition, a survey conducted in selected developing countries revealed that one quarter of the health facilities surveyed were not electrified, and another quarter had unscheduled outages, affecting their capacity to deliver essential health services. Such deficiencies weaken the health system’s response to the current health crisis.
The global electrification rate rose, from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent by 2018. Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia maintained strong progress, exceeding 98 per cent access to electricity by 2018. However, the world’s deficit was increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where some 548 million persons, or 53 per cent of the population, lacked access to electricity.
Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased to 63 per cent in 2018, from 60 per cent in 2015 and 56 per cent in 2010. Still, 2.8 billion persons lacked such access and relied primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. Because of the stagnant rate and rapid population growth, in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people without access to clean fuels for cooking increased.
The renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased, from 16.3 per cent in 2010 to 17.0 per cent in 2015 and 17.3 per cent in 2017. Much faster growth is required to meet long-term climate goals.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","Deficits in electricity are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa
The proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent in 2018, meaning that over 1 billion people acquired this essential service. Still, 789 million people – 85 per cent in rural areas – lacked electricity in 2018. Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia maintained strong progress, exceeding 98 per cent access by 2018. The deficit is increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting about 548 million people, or 53 per cent of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic spotlights the need for reliable and affordable electricity. A 2018 survey conducted in six African and Asian countries showed that one quarter of health facilities surveyed were not electrified, and another quarter experienced unscheduled outages, which affected their capacity for essential health services. Damage to equipment caused by poor connections and voltage fluctuations impacted 28 per cent of health centres. These deficits further weaken the response of health systems to the coronavirus crisis.
To meet the target of universal access to electricity by 2030, the annual rate of electrification has to rise from the current 0.82 percentage points to 0.87 for 2019 to 2030. At the current rate of progress, a projected 620 million people would still lack access to electricity in 2030. This estimate does not, however, take into account the disruptions caused by COVID-19.

## What is Lorem Ipsum?
__Lorem Ipsum__ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Immediate action to improve Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) is critical to preventing infection and containing its spread.
In 2018, 60 per cent of 172 countries reported very low, low and medium-low levels of implementation of integrated water resources management and were unlikely to meet the implementation target by 2030.
According to data from 67 countries, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017–2018. Only 17 countries reported that all of their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. ·
Globally, in 2018, slightly more than 2.1 per cent of land was covered by freshwater bodies, although unevenly distributed, ranging from 3.5 per cent in developed countries to only 1.4 per cent in developing countries and 1.2 per cent and 1 per cent in least developed countries and small island developing States, respectively. The adverse effects of climate change can decrease the extent of freshwater bodies, thereby worsening ecosystems and livelihoods.
ODA disbursements to the water sector increased to $9 billion, or 6 per cent, in 2018, following a decrease in such disbursements in 2017. However, ODA commitments fell by 9 per cent in 2018. Because countries have signalled a funding gap of 61 per cent between what is needed to achieve national drinking water and sanitation targets and available funding, increasing donor commitments to the water sector will remain crucial to make progress towards Goal 6.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","Closing the gaps in water, sanitation and hygiene are critical to containing the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases
The proportion of the global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 per cent in 2000 to 71 per cent in 2017. Despite progress, 2.2 billion people around the world still lacked safely managed drinking water, including 785 million without basic drinking water. The population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2017. However, 4.2 billion people worldwide still lacked safely managed sanitation, including 2 billion who were without basic sanitation. Of these, 673 million people practised open defecation.
Handwashing is one of the cheapest, easiest and most effective ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But in 2017, only 60 per cent of people had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home. In LDCs, the share was 28 per cent. This means that, in 2017, an estimated 3 billion people worldwide lacked the ability to safely wash their hands at home. The regional disparities are stark: in sub-Saharan Africa, 75 per cent of the population (767 million people) lacked basic handwashing facilities, followed by Central and Southern Asia at 42 per cent (807 million people), and Northern Africa and Western Asia at 23 per cent (116 million people).
Water, sanitation and hygiene services are not always available in places where people seek medical care: in 2016, one in four health care facilities around the world lacked basic water supplies, one in five had no sanitation services, and two in five had no soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, at points of care. Moreover, 47 per cent of schools worldwide lacked handwashing facilities with soap and water. Closing these gaps will be critical to providing effective health care and to containing the spread of COVID-19.","Global community",e134e88a-186d-4e02-83b7-c7eb460e96e8,ab67b0dd-0501-4c1e-a518-f639c1d20577

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.
","## How do I get started?

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

","## Who is involved with Alkemio?

The Alkemio Platform is fully open source, and relies on a combination of core development team and volunteer contributors.

In addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. Governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient economies and societies.
A total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030  to some extent since its adoption in 2015. In 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
As at 31 March 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action.
**Source**: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57","The world is way off track to meet the Paris Agreement target, signalling cataclysmic changes ahead
To mitigate the threat of runaway climate change, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This requires global emissions to peak as soon as possible, with a rapid fall of 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to continue to drop off steeply to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world is way off track in meeting this target at the current level of nationally determined contributions. Global greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries and economies in transition have declined by 6.5 per cent over the period 2000–2018. Meanwhile, the emissions of developing countries are up by 43.2 per cent from 2000 to 2013. The rise is largely attributable to increased industrialization and enhanced economic output measured in terms of GDP.
As of 31 March 2020, 189 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement, and 186 parties (185 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat. Three parties had communicated their second nationally determined contributions. In addition, 17 long-term strategies, 18 national adaptation plans, and 2 adaptation communications were submitted by parties. By 2020, parties are expected to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones, with a view to substantially increasing the ambitiousness of proposed climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has throttled economic activity and disrupted business as usual worldwide, offers an opportunity for countries to reassess priorities and to rebuild their economies to be greener and more resilient to climate change.","Global community",c00034e6-471a-44dc-87ab-36e8eefd013a,913cf4e7-9d63-4167-ab62-793c182830c9
