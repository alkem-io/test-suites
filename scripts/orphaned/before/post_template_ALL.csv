The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Space**](https://alkem.io/) - a Space on the production environment, but that is marked as Demonstration and may have some functionalities limited.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

    *   Note: this is as of Q2 2023 very out of date and a refresh is due, please contact us if you wish to have your own local setup.

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

*Empowering society. The platform to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.

<br>

## Why Alkemio?

Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing.

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: *"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."*

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:

*   [**Demo Environment**](https://demo.alkem.io/) - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to.

    *   If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.

*   [**Try it out locally**](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo) - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)
